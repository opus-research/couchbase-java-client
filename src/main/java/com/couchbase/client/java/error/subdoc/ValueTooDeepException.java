/**
 * Subdocument exception thrown when proposed value would make the document too deep to parse.
 *
 * The current limitation is there to ensure a single parse does not consume too much memory (overloading the server).
 * This error is similar to other TooDeep errors, which all relate to various validation stages to ensure the server
 * does not consume too much memory when parsing a single document.
